/**********************************************************************
 * The Greatest Common Divisor gcd(a, b) of two integers is the largest
 * integer that divides bot a and b. (This definition is meaningless
 * when both a and b are zero, but by convention gcd(0, 0)=0. It is 
 * easily shown that:
 * 	
 * 	gcd(a, b)=gcd(b, a rem b)
 * 	gcd(a, 0)=gcd(a when a>=0)
 *
 * Use these properties to construct a program (Euclid's algorithm)
 * that will compute the greatest common divisor of any two nonnegative
 * integers.
 *
 * 	ex:	gcd(13, 6) = gcd(6, 13%6) =
 * 		gcd(6, 1) = gcd(1, 6%1) =
 * 		gcd(1, 0) = 1
 *
 * 	ex:	gcd(21, 7) = gcd(7, 21%7) =
 * 		gcd(7, 0) = 7
