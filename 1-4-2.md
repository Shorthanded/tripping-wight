# Inference Rules for Specifications

Each inference rule consists of a sequence of zero or more specifications, called *premisses*, which are seperated by a long bar from a single specification called the *conclusion*.

  P<sub>1</sub>
  
  &#x22EE;
  
  P<sub>n</sub>
  --------
  P

Simple Assignment:
-------
{P|<sub>X&#x2192;E</sub>}X:=E{P}

so:
{y&#x00D7;y<4}y:=y&#x00D7;y{y<4}

or:
{(y-z)&#x00D7;(y-z)<4}y:=y-z{y&#x00D7;y<4}
